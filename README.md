Visualizing Seattle's bike count data; tump-tump go the tires over pneumatic tubes...

Seattle provides hourly bike count data from several locations across the city. It's presented in tabular format, so it could use some more engaging visualization. Especially useful would be some time-series charts to compare year-over-year changes in counts. 

Jake V. did some heavy (stats analysis) [https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/10/is-seattle-really-seeing-an-uptick-in-cycling/] of this data using pandas. The city pays the data collector to (visualize) [http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/bikecounter_spokane.htm] a couple locations, but there lots o tubes (or maybe loops under the pavement?) across the city, and problem more coming. 

(Here's) [https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/26th-Ave-SW-Greenway-at-SW-Oregon-St/mefu-7eau] where the city provides the bike data. 

Thoughts:

  - select locations from a map
  - view average counts by hour, latest trends for the year, comparisons versus last year, etc.
  - contrast with weather and other factors, a la Jake V.'s analysis
